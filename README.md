Despite strong competition app won first place price.

This app is designed to help people with autism, small children and any other group of people who can't or just not feel comfortable with verbal communication. It allows to make sentences using pictures. Thanks to this application they can comunicate with thier parents, peers and teachers. Every picture represents a word and a sound, so every user, no matter if he or she is disabled or not can underestand it and easly use, but also learn new words. 

This Application can be integrated with any communicator or chat. During hacathon it was successfully integrated with [LiveChat](https://www.livechatinc.com/).
